$ 10@@ ,000 Gold ?
SA@@ N F@@ R@@ AN@@ C@@ IS@@ C@@ O – It has never been easy to have a r@@ ational con@@ vers@@ ation about the value of g@@ old .
L@@ ately , with g@@ old prices up more than 300 % over the last dec@@ ade , it is har@@ der than ever .
Just last December , fel@@ low econom@@ ists Mar@@ tin Fel@@ d@@ stein and N@@ our@@ iel Rou@@ bin@@ i each p@@ enn@@ ed op - eds bra@@ vely quest@@ ion@@ ing b@@ ul@@ lish market s@@ enti@@ ment , sen@@ si@@ bly poin@@ ting out g@@ old ’s ris@@ ks .
W@@ ould n’t you know it ?
Since their artic@@ les appear@@ ed , the price of g@@ old has mo@@ ved up still further .
Gold prices even h@@ it a record - high $ 1,@@ 300 recently .
L@@ ast December , many g@@ old bu@@ gs were ar@@ gu@@ ing that the price was in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably he@@ aded for $ 2@@ ,000 .
Now , em@@ b@@ ol@@ den@@ ed by continu@@ ing ap@@ preci@@ ation , some are suggest@@ ing that g@@ old could be he@@ aded even higher than that .
One successful g@@ old invest@@ or recently expl@@ ained to me that sto@@ ck prices langu@@ ished for a more than a dec@@ ade before the D@@ ow J@@ ones inde@@ x cro@@ ss@@ ed the 1@@ ,000 mark in the early 198@@ 0@@ ’s .
